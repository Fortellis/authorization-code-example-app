# Authorization Code

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Follow the tutorial on how to build and run this app locally on the [Node.js Authorization Code Tutorial](https://docs.fortellis.io/docs/tutorials/solution-tutorial/authorization-code-flow-tutorial/).

The app performs the authorization code flow to acquire an authorization code and then uses that code to get an authorization token. You can see the authorization toke in the browser console and on the command line.
